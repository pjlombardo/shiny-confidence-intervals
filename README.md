# Shiny Apps for Confidence Intervals
This is a repository for shiny apps that help to visualize confidence 
intervals.

* `CI_Cat`: Allows the user to look at a sample percentage, and its 
corresponding confidence interval (the user chooses the margin of error), 
over several samples. It shows the long-term success rate of the 
confidence interval process for a given margin of error.
* Coming soon...
